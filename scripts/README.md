## Script folder
This folder contains scripts for several tasks such as:
- `check_bfs.py`: checks whether the MultiGrpah BFS produced a correct BFS tree;
- `graph_gen.py`: is a graph generator according to the Erdős–Rényi model;
- `run_test.py`: executes Simple BFS tests several times and collects performance metrics;
